	<p>This s a web app created in response to the current era of bloat.</p>
	<div class="flex flex-col">
		<p>The idea is simple:</p>
		<p>• <b>NO</b> to clutter</p>
		<p>• <b>NO</b> to adds</p>
		<p>• <b>NO</b> to collecting your data</p>
	</div>
	<div class="flex flex-col gap-[0.1rem]">

			Nowadays nothing is for the consumer. The consumer <b>is</b> the product. I am completely fed up
			with this reality.
		</p>
		<p>
			The clean cookbook is the first instalment in a series of web apps that follow my missions -
			make software <i>clean</i> again.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>It is not an another social media app by choice, it is to be Yours.</p>
	<div class="flex flex-col gap-[0.1rem]">
		<p>
			For now, the app is completely free. If, at any point, the free tiers of services that this app
			is based on get exhausted, I will implement to options:
		</p>
		<p>1. pay a very small amount for keeping your data online.</p>
		<p>2. host this app privately completely for free.</p>
